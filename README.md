code jam coding challenge: my solution

In A.D. 2100, aliens came to Earth. They wrote a message in a cryptic 
language, and next to it they wrote a series of symbols. We've come 
to the conclusion that the symbols indicate a number: the number of 
seconds before war begins!

Unfortunately we have no idea what each symbol means. We've decided 
that each symbol indicates one digit, but we aren't sure what each 
digit means or what base the aliens are using. For example, if they 
wrote "ab2ac999", they could have meant "31536000" in 
base 10 -- exactly one year -- or they could have meant "12314555" 
in base 6 -- 398951 seconds, or about four and a half days. 
We are sure of three things: the number is positive; like us, 
the aliens will never start a number with a zero; and they aren't 
using unary (base 1).

Your job is to determine the minimum possible number of seconds 
before war begins.
